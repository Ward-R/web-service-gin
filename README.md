# web-service-gin

This is my first gin/go project following a tutorial from the go.dev website. This is a RESTful API with go and gin. This is an API server with two endpoints containing a local repository of data about vintage jazz records.

## Built With
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - Backend
- [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) - Front-end Gin/Go

## Acknowledgements
I followed the above mentioned tutorial to make this API, so it is not original work. The purpose was to further my knowledge in the Go language and Gin framework.
